# link2GI

`link2gi` provides functions that make it a bit easier to connect most of the common open source GI software packages to the R-biotop in a straightforward way. It supports both the use of wrapper packages and the direct use via system calls. It focuses on `Linux` and `WindowsX` operating systems but nevertheless it should also work with `OSX`.

To utilize the power of the open source GI tools from within `R` you need to install  them first. As a first promising opportunity to do fullfil most of the requirements you may install `QGIS, GRASS`- and `SAGA-GIS` following the excellent [installation instructions](https://github.com/jannes-m/RQGIS/blob/master/vignettes/install_guide.Rmd)  of the [RQGIS](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RQGIS/index.html) package will have a good first try to ensure a smooth working environment. Note: for most of the cases you may use just `RQGIS` as wrapper for the `QGIS` related functionality. 

If you have several versions installed or if you want to use the full power of the GI software it will be a nice and helpful tool to deal with some strange behaviours and requirements. Especially helpful is the support of `OTB`, the `GDAL-Python` functions and (at least until the well known `RSAGA` wrapper package is updated) a simple support to use any `SAGA` version  straightforward via the CLI. Hopefully the `RSAGA` update will fusion with the new and very promising  [`Rsagacmd`](https://github.com/stevenpawley/Rsagacmd) wrapper package which is providing a list oriented wrapping concept. Even if powerful in dealing with the most `SAGA GIS` issues by itself it may be used seamingless with `link2GI::findSAGA` function for to identify and with `link2GI::linkSAGA` to link the preferred version.

Next release will add an interface to `liblas` and `LAStools` and `Fusion`. Furthermore it is also planned to link the `taudem`  and some more exotic GI tool binaries.
