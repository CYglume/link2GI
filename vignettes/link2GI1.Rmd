R has quite a lot of classes for storing and dealing with spatial data. For vector data the [sp](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sp) and recently the great [sf](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sf) packages are well known and the raster data world is widley covered by the [raster](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=raster) package. Additionally external spatial data formats are interfaced by wrapping packages as [rgdal](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rgdal) or [gdalUtils](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=gdalUtils). For more specific links as needed for manipulating atmospheric modeling packages as [ncdf4](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ncdf4) are very helpful.

The spatial analysis itself is often supported by wrapper packages that integrate external libraries, command line tools or a mixture of both in an R-like syntax [rgeos](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rgeos), [geosphere](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=geosphere), [Distance](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Distance), [maptools](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=maptools), [igraph](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=igraph) or [spatstat](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=spatstat). It  would be a never ending story to complete this list. 

Despite all this possibilities it can be confirmed (at least from a non-R point of view) that there  is a big gap between R and the major opensource Geographic Information System (GIS) and Remote Sensing (RS) software tools. GRASS GIS and SAGA GIS provides a comprehensive, established collection of highly sophisticated algorithms. They are fast and stable and most of them are well proofed. Most spatial R  users know that there are some really good wrapper packages for bridging the gap around. For [GRASS GIS](https://grass.osgeo.org/) it is [rgrass7](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rgrass7) and for [SAGA GIS](http://www.saga-gis.org/)  the [RSAGA](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RSAGA) package. 

Unfortunately  both wrappers are lacking to be easy to use. SAGA GIS is the continously changing the syntax of the command line interfaces (CLI). So the development of RSAGA is somewhat frozen on a release below 2.2.3. On the other hand needs GRASS GIS  a very sophisticated environment and setup which is very cumbersome. Furthermore it it getting really complicated on Windows platforms.

The [link2GI](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RSAGA) package tries to open an easy to use entrance door for linking GRASS and SAGA GIS as well as other command line tools like the Orfeo Toolbox (OTB). 

This vignette:

* explains what is meant by linking the GIS/R world to R
* shows how to use it according to specific system requirements
* provides examples of how you can work with them
* give some examples of how they can be used for meaningful and more efficient spatial analysis

# What means linking?
